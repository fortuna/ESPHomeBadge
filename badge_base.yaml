# Note on RMT symbols:
# ESP32-C3 has memory for only 192 RMT symbols, only half of which is available to transmitters.
# We have the following defaults:
# - esp32_rmt_led_strip: 96
# - remote_transmitter: 48
# - remote_receiver: 192
# We change it to the following allocation:
# - esp32_rmt_led_strip: 48
# - remote_transmitter: 48
# - remote_receiver: 86
